# Trie-header-file-implementation

This project contains 2 files - main.cpp and myTrie.h main.cpp - It is a helper file to just run the myTrie.h file on some sample test cases, you can edit it in your way for different purposes. myTrie.h - It is the header file that contains various pre-defined functions that are necessary in tries. Functions included -

1. insert - to insert a new word in the trie
2. erase - to delete a word from the trie
3. isPresent - to check whether the word is present in the trie or not
